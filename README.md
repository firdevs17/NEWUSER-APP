### According to the assigned task, it is not possible to register on the site without filling in "User Roles", "Email" and "Enabled".
### If the user does not provide the requested information, the site interface gives a warning.

### If the requested information is given, the code written by flask is sent to the PostgreSQL newuser database, saved in the register table and saved.

### The success.html code is to notify users that they have registered after they have registered.
