# NEWUSER-APP

## I used Python-Flask in this project.

### Firstly i created the html interface

### If the user does not provide the requested information, the site interface gives a warning.

### If the requested information is given, the code written by flask is sent to the PostgreSQL newuser database, saved in the register table and saved.

### The success.html code is to notify users that they have registered after they have registered.
