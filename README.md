# NEWUSER-APP

## * I used Python-Flask in this project.

### * Firstly i created the html interface

### * According to the assigned task, it is not possible to register on the site without filling in "User Roles", "Email" and "Enabled".
### * If the user does not provide the requested information, the site interface gives a warning.

### * If the requested information is given, the code written by flask is sent to the PostgreSQL newuser database, saved in the register table and saved.

### * The success.html code is to notify users that they have registered after they have registered.
